# weather-dashboard-api

Building a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

# Description 

The main purpose to build this is to displays current weather conditions in a city as well as the five-day forecast. Third-party APIs are used to access weather data by sending requests to a URL with specific parameters.


# What does this project do? and how?

The user enters the name of a city into the search field in this app, then clicks the search button. The app will show the current weather conditions in that city, such as temperature, humidity, UV index, and a picture indicating whether it is clear, cloudy, or raining.

When a user searches for a city, a button with that information is created beneath the search field. When the user clicks on that button, a new search for that location is launched. Furthermore, if the user closes the window or refreshes the browser, the search history buttons remain, and the app opens with weather results for the last city searched for.


## User Story

```
AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history

WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index

WHEN I view the UV index
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe

WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity

WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
